                <h2>Thinking about a dog?</h2>
                
                <p>Dogs are man's best friend for a reason. They love unconditionally, guard us from harm, and are eager to please. Let's be real, a cat is more of a roommate&mdash;they provide you with company now and then, when they feel like it, but otherwise they have a life entirely their own. Dogs are more of a true pet: they depend on you for care and attention.</p>
                
                <p>Of course, there are also pros and cons to owning a dog.</p>

                <h3>PROS</h3>

                <p>Dogs are people pleasers. Ask a dog to sit, stay, come, roll over, give paw and your dog will work hard to make you happy. Dogs have lived for centuries with humans and it is deep in their genes their need to work to please their humans. Whether, your dog must pull a sleigh or gather sheep, the dog will do it and even promptly.</p>

                <p>Dogs are social. You can take your dog easily on vacation with you and as long as they are with their owners they are fine. Territory is not a big deal for them and they can move to a different place each day with not much fuss. In nature, dogs tend to move a lot in search of food and they are used to changing their habitat quite often. Living with their pack is what mostly counts.</p>

                <p>Dogs promote healthy lifestyles. Dog owners are kept healthy because dogs need walked. Dog owners lead a healthy lifestyle when exposed to fresh air everyday as they walk their dog vigorously in the morning. Dogs also unlike exercise programs ensure consistency because owners must always walk their dogs cutting off the risk of procrastinating.</p>

                <p>Dogs are fun. A dog can learn many games and they can keep a family entertained. Dogs may fetch and play hide and seek. They can be enrolled in agility classes or pull carts. They can learn a lot of tricks and they can go swimming in lakes or run in the sand on the beach. There many fun activities owners can share with their dogs.</p>

                <p>Dogs are loyal. Dogs are very devoted to their owners. Some have even died from the sorrow following their owner's death.

                <h3>CONS</h3>

                <p>Dogs need maintenance. Yes, some need their anal glands expressed others need frequent baths because they may be smelly.. They need chew toys and bones to keep their teeth in good condition and grooming sessions to keep their fur nice and tidy. They need to obediencetrained and they must learn leash manners. Dogs are more costly than cats and require more care.</p>

                <p>Dogs depend on humans. Some dogs suffer from great separation anxiety when left alone. Others may bare with their owner's absence but cannot be left alone too long because they need to be fed, sent out to potty and because they tend to feel lonely. Dogs require to be boarded or brought along when owners must leave from several hours to a week end. It is a sad fact that dogs are often abandoned because of this.</p>

                <p>Dogs chew. A puppy's teething may turn into a nightmarish even. If not redirected to chew toys and bones most dogs will try to gnaw on the attractive dining room's table legs or even through the drywall. Some dogs still will chew for the rest of their lives if not trained early on what behaviors are acceptable and which are not. However, most dogs will learn their boundaries and will learn to leave your furniture alone.</p>

                <p>Dogs need to be walked. That nippy morning walk may feel like a chore to some dog owners. Truth is, your dog will need to be walked 365 days a years because they need to have their bowel movements. Hiring a dog walker may be costly and procastrinating may mean ruining your well housebroken dog. It is a fact that like it or not your dog must be walked rain or shine and even snow.</p>

                <p>Dogs are bulky. Large dogs may not be permitted in apartment complexes and some breeds are even banned lately from communities. If you are planning to move, you must do your research well as some places will not allow dogs over a certain weight. An 80 pound dog may also feel like a cow in a china store once it grows up to its potential and it may tug at leash in such a manner of making its owner fall.</p>
