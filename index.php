                <h2>So you're thinking about taking the plunge into pet parenthood.</h2>
                
                <p>You've got a little too much love to give and nobody in your life is having any of it&mdash;what better solution is there than an animal whose entire wellbeing depends on you? Now the main question is, which furry bastard do you want to take home? Well obviously there are a multitude of options but because this is homework and I don't want to sit in front of the computer for hours on end doing research on ferrets, we're restricting our scope to popular pets that are heavier than bowling balls.</p>

                <p>Pet ownership has many aspects to it and pet personalities are complex in varied, so generalizing cats and dogs to stereotypes is often not representative of the actual experience. But we're gonna do it anyway. Below is a brief summary of differences between the two.</p>
